## Description
In this assignment the student was tasked with building a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

This assignment was also a great way for me to gain some hands on skills in using PWA's

## Notes

1. The Team Profile Generator will allow you to build 3 profiles for a manager, engineer, and intern
2. The Team Profile Generator will generate the profiles on an HTML page
3. The each job selection has a unique color code.
4. The Team Profile Generator will prompt the neccessary questions via the terminal server using Node.js

## Visuals
